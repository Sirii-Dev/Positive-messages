#positive-messages
    Whenever I start a new project, I don't know what to write for the first commit. After doing a “git init” there is technically nothing there...

##Install
''' npm
    npm install -g random-msg
'''

#Usage
'''bash
    positive-msg
'''

#Contributing
    If someone wants to add or improve something, I invite you to collaborate directly in this repository: https://github.com/siriweb/Positive-messages
